# Moduni

**Moduni is an editor extension for the game engine Unity. It allows users to share their code between projects through the creation of modules. These modules can be easily imported in new projects and managed separately with the help of versions and dependencies. It uses standard technologies such as Git and NuGet to do its job.**
